# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This script scans a given website or IP address for common vulnerabilities. It performs security checks for:
- Open ports
- Exposed admin panels
- Security headers
- Common vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations)
- Detection of exposed JavaScript files that may contain sensitive information

## Features
- Scans web applications for potential security risks
- Checks for open network ports
- Detects missing or misconfigured security headers
- Identifies exposed JavaScript files that may contain API keys
- Generates a detailed security report

## Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install requests bs4 socket python-nmap
```

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:
```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py -u <target_url>
```
Example:
```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py -u https://example.com
```
For network scanning, use:
```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py -i <target_ip>
```
Example:
```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py -i 192.168.1.1
```

## Output
The script generates a security report in the terminal and optionally saves it to a file.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement multi-threading for faster scans
- Add integration with a vulnerability database (e.g., CVE database)
- Improve reporting format (e.g., JSON, CSV output)

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes only. Do not use it on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
